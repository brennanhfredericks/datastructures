    - The heap is one maximally efficient implementation of an abstract data type called a priority queue, and in fact, priority queues are often referred to as "heaps"
    - in a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C. 
    - In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C.[2] 
    - The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.
    - When a heap is a complete binary tree, it has a smallest possible heightâ€”a heap with N nodes and for each node a branches always has loga N height.


    implementation
        
        - Thus the children of the node at position n would be at positions 2n and 2n + 1 in a one-based array, or 2n + 1 and 2n + 2 in a zero-based array.
        - Computing the index of the parent node of n-th element is also straightforward. For one-based arrays the parent of element n is located at position n/2. 
          Similarly, for zero-based arrays, the parent is located at position (n-1)/2 (floored).
        - Balancing a heap is done by sift-up or sift-down operations (swapping elements which are out of order).
